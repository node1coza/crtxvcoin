Intro
-----
Crtxvcoin is a free open source project derived from Bitcoin,
with the goal of providing a long-term energy-efficient scrypt-based crypto-currency. 
Built on the foundation of Bitcoin using the Libzerocoin extention, 
Crtxvcoin will be  Proof-Of-Work until block 100000,
then it became pure Proof-Of-Stake.
